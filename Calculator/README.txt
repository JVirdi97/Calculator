Hello, and thank you for downloading this calculator!

This file will tell you which functions the calculator supports, and how to use them.
Case is irrelevant for all of these functions. functions can be entered UPPER, lower or EiThEr case.

This calculator will also return True or False if you enter an inequality, e.g. 2>1 will return True. You can also check if two expressions
are equal e.g. 5-2=4-1 will return True.


Trigonometric functions:
In these functions, x is in radians. To convert from degrees to radians, use the following:
x degrees = (pi/180)*x radians
e.g. 90 degrees is (pi/180)*90 radians = pi/2 radians
Conversely,
x radians = (180/pi)*x degrees
e.g. pi/6 radians is (180/pi) * (pi/6) degrees = 30 degrees

sin(x)
Returns the sine of x.
e.g. sin(pi/2) will return 1.

cos(x)
Returns the cosine of x.
e.g. cos(pi/2) will return 0.

tan(x)
Returns the tangent of x.
e.g. tan(pi/4) will return 1.

If you omit brackets on these functions, there will be an error.


Inverse Trigonometric functions:
These functions also have x in radians just like above.

These functions will return the answer in the range [-pi, pi]

NOTE: These functions have 'a' as the prefix which tells the calculator that they are inverse. In other works you may see the 'arc'
prefix, or to the power of negative one (e.g. cos^-1(x)); however this calculator does not support these function names.

asin(x)
Returns the inverse sine of x.
e.g. sin(1) will return pi/2.

acos(x)
Returns the cosine of x.
e.g. cos(pi/2) will return 0.

atan(x)
Returns the tangent of x.
e.g. tan(pi/4) will return 1.

If you omit brackets on these functions, there will be an error.


Exponential functions:
x has to be a real number. In the case of ln(x), x has to be a positive real number.

exp(x)
Returns e^x.
e.g. exp(3) = e^3, which is roughly equal to 20.08553

ln(x)
Returns the natural logarithm of x. x>0 is required, as ln is undefined for real x =< 0
e.g. ln(e) = 1


Basic arithmetic operators:
Addition	(+)
Subtraction	(-)
Multiplication	(*)
Divide		(/)
Exponentiation	(^)


Constants:
Some mathematical constants.
e	Euler's number. Roughly equal to 2.71828. I recommend learning about this number and its applications if you want to study maths

pi	Pi. The ratio of a circles circumference to its diameter. Roughly equal to 3.14159. Has applications in physics and maths.
